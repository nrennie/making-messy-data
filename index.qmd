abstract: |
  Equipping students in statistics and data science with the necessary data wrangling skills to handle real-world data is a crucial aspect of their education. Real data, unlike the clean, structured examples often used in teaching, can include a variety of challenges such as typographical errors, missing values encoded in unconventional ways, unexpected spaces, or other inconsistencies that stem from human error or software incompatibility. These issues are common in real datasets and are essential for students to learn how to address in order to develop the practical skills needed for professional data analysis.

  However, while real data offers these valuable learning opportunities, it can also be too messy and unpredictable to be useful in a time-constrained classroom environment. Teaching with such data may overwhelm students or detract from core statistical concepts. To address this, this paper presents an R package designed to introduce controlled levels of messiness into existing, clean teaching datasets. This package allows educators to retain the structure and simplicity of familiar teaching examples while providing students with a realistic, manageable data cleaning experience. By using this approach, instructors can implicitly teach critical data wrangling techniques, preparing students for the complexities they will encounter in real-world data analysis.
